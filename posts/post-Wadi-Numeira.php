                        Jordan's canyons, my last stops of Jordan.

                    In spring 2023, after spending two weeks hiking through Jordan, I was making my way back to Amman. Because public 
                    transport isn't very reliable in Jordan, I mostly hitchhiked around. People in Jordan are generally very 
                    friendly and helpful, so hitchhiking was fun and easy. I made my way to Wadi Numeira, a beautiful canyon 
                    used by tourists and locals as a picnic area and hiking attraction. It is also used as a herding area since
                     it's the only green part of the earth around. Some people even sleep inside the canyon, which is probably 
                     completely safe as long as you check the forecast for rain. I slept at the beginning of the canyon near a 
                     simple parking lot. In the morning, I went early to keep up with the schedule. I left my big backpack a couple
                      of hundred meters in the canyon behind some rocks, quite hidden by my standards.

                    I went through the canyon; the water was cold and refreshing, and the canyon walls sometimes towered around 
                    me with 30 meters of height. The canyon isn't that long, so I was done in about 2 or 3 hours, even though I 
                    took my time and also explored the area after the initial canyon. On my way back, I met some people, and then
                     I went to retrieve my backpack. Unfortunately, the backpack wasn't there. I thought about what to do, and 
                     after looking around, I started to talk to people that were resting or spending their time at the mouth of 
                     the canyon to see if they saw anything by any chance. The tourists didn't see anything, and the locals told
                      me to talk to some kids that were hanging around. I talked to them through a translator and other means, of
                       course, but they said they didn't see anything. I gave my contacts to some workers who told me they would 
                       ring me in case the backpack turned up. Since I had the important things on me, I decided to skip the next
                        canyon and hitch a ride back to Amman.

                    I just started hitching when my phone rang. I gave the phone to a local I was talking to at the moment, and he 
                    translated for me that the workers had found the backpack and were bringing it over. I was relieved, and after
                     inspecting the now-returned backpack, I realized I had only lost two of my knives. I gave away my power
                      bank/flashlight to the workers since they were looking at it funny, and I wanted to express my thanks 
                      somehow. I suspect that the kids just took the bag and ransacked it, stealing the knives, because even 
                      the adults suspected them. I didn't press the matter further and was on my way to the other canyon.
                       After three short hitches, I made my way  <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/31%C2%B027'00.6%22N+35%C2%B
                       033'56.7%22E/@31.4501528,35.5631818,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d31.4501528!4d35.5657567?entry=ttu"
                        target="_blank">here</a>. At the time, I just thought there would be a trailhead 
                       kind of area that would lead me to the canyon. I came to a fenced area, separating the road from any 
                       possible way to the mountains.

                    After looking around and tasting (not recommended) the Dead Sea, I found my way in; there was a water tunnel
                     connecting the sea and the other side of the road. I went through, had lunch in the tunnel since it was the
                      only place with any form of shadow. After resting, I went on to the canyon; the path had no shadow at all,
                       and the area seemed quite sketchy to wander around. It's made of a sandy material, looked undermined by 
                       rainwater, and other than the path I was following, wasn't really stable.

                    I made my way to the canyon that surprisingly had a big amount of water. I was kind of worried about being
                     able to come back through the current and all, but I took my waterproof bag anyway and was on my way. It's
                      about a 1 km long canyon until you get to a waterfall. You can rappel this as part of a tour that goes 
                      through here, but I came here just before the tours began, so I just took some pictures and went back. 
                      I very much enjoyed this area, and after getting back to my backpack (yes, I left it behind again even 
                      after the accident) at around 6 p.m., I made camp nearby. I prepared some wood for a fire, and after night
                       came, I tried to dry my clothes. I waited for night so that no one would be able to see the smoke 
                       (since I was in a restricted area and all). Unfortunately, the fire was gone just as fast as it had begun; 
                       the wood is very dry, so it gets consumed very fast. By the way, the water from the second canyon tasted 
                       quite bad, even through a filter, so I would recommend to anyone coming after me not to rely on water from 
                       the canyon.
