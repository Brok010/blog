                    <p>
                    My family and I went to Georgia for the 2023 spring holidays. We rented a car and explored the 
                    usual tourist places of Georgia. Since I took part in preparing the itinerary for this trip, I 
                    got to explore some places I wanted to see, even though I had to compromise a lot. One of the 
                    trails I wanted to explore was the path from Mazeri to Mestia, which I am going to write about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    My brother and I started this trail from a homestay in the village. At around 8 a.m., my 
                    brother had a slightly broken arm back then, in a cast, but we didn't think it would pose a
                     problem. We began the climb; the terrain, although steep, wasn't too challenging, and we 
                     reached Guli Pass in about 3 hours - both of us being in good physical condition. We took
                      several breaks to replenish water, eat, drink tea, or simply rest. At the pass, we decided 
                      to leave the trail and follow the ridge. In the summer, this is a good option to consider if 
                      you have time. You get to see the other side of the mountains and the glacier hiding there. 
                      However, in early spring, it was not so easy. The snow was still melting, and we were 
                      carrying only jackets and hoodies, nothing too warm in case of an emergency or such. 
                    </p>

                    <img src="../img/Mestia/2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="ascent" style="width: 75%;"/>

                        We climbed another 400 vertical meters when we first noticed that the sky was getting too 
                        dark for our standards. We picked up the pace, but the snow was deep and wet. As I 
                        mentioned before, my brother had only one useful arm at the time. However, since we 
                        were approximately in the middle of the ridge, we didn't see a reason to go back, 
                        other than the possibility that the path we were following might end at some point. 
                        I decided to take the risk, believing in the map we had. We wanted to at least get 
                        off the ridge before the storm arrived, but we didn't manage even that, and the storm 
                        caught us just below the highest point of this little adventure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We considered taking shelter but decided otherwise. We pressed on to stay warm and 
                        hopefully start our descent. Luckily, the storm didn't last too long, and we had some 
                        visibility for the descent. We took a break at Koruldi Lakes around 3 p.m., cooked some 
                        food, and swam in the lake. Considering we were already quite cold, this wasn't such a 
                        good idea, but cold exposure is healthy, so it can't be that bad. Anyway, it was just 
                        starting to rain a bit again, so we packed up and headed down to Mestia town. In this part,
                         we joined the trail again and met some people doing day hikes from the city. After about 2 
                         hours, we reached the city.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Those hours were arguably the worst because both of us were quite tired, and the constant
                         descent just hurt our knees. All in all, it was a nice walk. We were kind of scared of 
                         dying in the storm, but it turned out fine, and the dinner afterward tasted even more 
                         delicious."
