                        I completed this trail in the summer of 2022. At that time, tourism in Thailand had 
                        just experienced a year-long pause due to Covid. Consequently, I had the opportunity 
                        to explore many typically crowded places entirely on my own. The only downside was that 
                        some areas, including this trail, were left unkempt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The trail takes at least 8 hours to walk, I would say, if you take your time. 
                        When the conditions are right, National Park officials organize expeditions for tourists. 
                        These expeditions usually span overnight, and participants sleep just below the peak. 
                        The trail naturally takes longer if you carry tents and other equipment with you. 
                        According to the national park's rules, this trail is prohibited to be done alone - 
                        at least that's the information I gathered from both the web and locals. But that never
                        really stopped me before. So, I left my rented motorbike 
                        <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/14%C2%B040'52.9%22N+98%C2%B021'54.0%22E/@14.681441,98.3646837,19.25z/data=!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d14.6813583!4d98.3650114?entry=ttu" target="_blank">here</a>
                        in Ban-E-Tong village at around 1 p.m., and I was on my way up. Quite late? For sure. That's why I jogged 
                        when the slope wasn't too steep. The trail was overgrown and muddy - per usual in rainy season.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was about an hour in when I first noticed a leech stuck to my calf.
                        I took my knife and cut it off. However, the trail became even more overgrown,
                        and suddenly, I had to make my way through bushes and very high grass. Also,
                        it was slightly raining at times, so the conditions were just perfect for leeches. 
                        After that, I stopped about every half an hour to cut off leeches that were making 
                        their way to my skin. Mind you, I was wearing full-length trekking pants. But I didn't 
                        stop; it was something I wanted to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, the peak was in fog. On my way down, the rain was about to get heavier, 
                        so I decided to jog down whenever it was safe to do so. The trail took me about 6 hours, 
                        and I counted about 17 leeches that I had to cut off. I made it back to the village at 7 p.m., 
                        had something to eat, and was on my way back to Kanchanaburi

                        The real challenge was getting back. It's about a 2.5-hour drive on a scooter that I rented.
                        It was already dark, cold, and raining. I had some clothes prepared just in case, but 
                        nonetheless, I was cold. Also, the leeches I talked about? They made my blood so diluted
                        that I just couldn't stop the bleeding. Looking back, I should have used my first aid kit
                        and bandaged it to stop at least a bit of the blood loss, but I didn't. I just let it 
                        bleed, thinking it would stop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the way back, I stopped at a gas vending machine to fill up a little and at 7/11 to
                        do the same for myself. All in all, I got to Kanchanaburi at about midnight.

                        I was glad I got back; unfortunately, the only hostel in town—the one I stayed in before I 
                        went on this little adventure—was already closed. Luckily, a guest let me in, and I just took 
                        the bed I had before. The grandma taking care of the hostel didn't mind, and I made sure to 
                        get even with her the following morning. So yeah, I had a place to sleep. But I still had my 
                        shoes full of blood, and my pants were soaked too. I went to the bathroom to check the 
                        situation, and to my surprise, the bleeding didn't stop. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I went to the shower, didn't bother taking clothes off since they were full of blood or 
                        rainwater anyway, and proceeded to clean the clothes and myself. After 2 hours at 2 a.m., 
                        I was ready for bed, still bleeding a little, but I made sure to bandage it so that I don't
                        mess up the bed. The next morning, I returned the bike, and with a minor headache from the 
                        blood loss, I continued on my way. Looking back, it was quite a situation—being in a hostel 
                        without the owner's permission, cleaning clothes full of blood at 2 a.m., but as usual, all 
                        was good.
