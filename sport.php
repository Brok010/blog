                      In my teens (13-18) I spent great amount of time with sports.
                      Trough out my whole childhood me and my family would visit these friendly races that were being held in the region where we lived.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      At the age of 13 I started to actually practice with the intention of getting better at the sport - then cycling.
                      And around the age of 15 I transitioned into triathlon since it seemed like a better option back then.
                      At the age of 17 I became a part of Czech represantation team, and at the age of 18 I ended my carrier because of a knee injury.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was never a competitive person, but i liked the feeling of getting better at something. Idk if I'm ever getting back to racing,
                    but 5 years later, I still continue doing these sports, but now just a little less intense.
